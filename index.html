        <p>
          Co je vlastně C++? C++ je velmi komplexní a pravděpodobně vůbec jeden z nejtěžších
           jazyků na naučení. Kombinuje vysokou rychlost jazyka C s novým objektově orientovaným
            přístupem moderních jazyků jako např. Java, C# .NET nebo PHP. Je velmi dobrou volbou
             pro aplikace, které vyžadují vysoký výkon (např. webové prohlížeče nebo AAA hry)

            <h3>Další oběť</h3>
            <p title="No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known
as the Gaffer. He held forth at _The Ivy Bush_, a small inn on the Bywater
road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag
End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that.
Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was
mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on
very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in
Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.">

            <h3>Another Something</h3>
            <p title="Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively
combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something
quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be
_eleventy-one,_ 111, a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a
hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be
_thirty-three,_ 33) an important number: the date of his 'coming of age'.
 Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming
event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo
Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.">

            <h3>Something</h3>
            <p title="When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be
celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence,
there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.
 Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the
Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected
return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local
legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that
the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was
not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time
wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was
much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him _well_-
preserved, but _unchanged_ would have been nearer the mark. There were some
that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it
seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well
as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
 'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and trouble
will come of it!'">

            <h3>Another Something</h3>
            <p title="But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his
money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good
fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course,
the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits
of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of
his younger cousins began to grow up.
 The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When
Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live
at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed.
Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. 'You had
better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and then we can
celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that time Frodo was
still in his _tweens,_ as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties
between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.">
