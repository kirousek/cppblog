        <p>
          Co je vlastně C++? C++ je velmi komplexní a pravděpodobně vůbec jeden z nejtěžších
           jazyků na naučení. Kombinuje vysokou rychlost jazyka C s novým objektově orientovaným
            přístupem moderních jazyků jako např. Java, C# .NET nebo PHP. Je velmi dobrou volbou
             pro aplikace, které vyžadují vysoký výkon (např. webové prohlížeče nebo AAA hry)

            <h3 title="When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be
celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence,
there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.
 Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the
Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected
return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local
legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that
the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was
not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time
wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was
much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him _well_-
preserved, but _unchanged_ would have been nearer the mark. There were some
that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it
seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well
as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
 'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and trouble
will come of it!'">Something</h3>

            <h3>Another Something</h3>
            <p title="But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his
money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good
fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course,
the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits
of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of
his younger cousins began to grow up.
 The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When
Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live
at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed.
Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. 'You had
better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and then we can
celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that time Frodo was
still in his _tweens,_ as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties
between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.">
